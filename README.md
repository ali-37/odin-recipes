# odin-recipes
First project for The Odin Project

Basic HTML-only project including a homepage and 3 separate recipe pages.

Used skills such as:
- Creating and organising files and directories from the command line
- Writing basic HTML boilerplate from memory
- Using heading and paragraph elements to organise text
- Used the anchor element and href attribute to make links (only relative links used in this particular project)
Used the image element with the src and alt attributes to include images in the project
Made ordered and unordered lists using their respective elements as well as the list item element
Used the semantic elements to make some text bold and italic
Used git to regularly stage and commit my work to show my progress and make it possible to revert to past commits if I ran into any issues
